# NimGame Project
## The goal of this project, is to make a program that can be unbeatable at playing the nimgame
*What is nimgame?*

NimGame is a game, played by two opponents in which the objective is to manage a way of making the other player stick with the last ball/match/. 
The game can be constructed with _n_ rows, each row containing an odd number. You can find some solutions to this game rewarding the _n = 4_ case. However this code, can perform at _n_ in _{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}_ levels. And can be unbeatable at this cases, depending on how many rows has the game. 

Here's an example of Nimgame with n = 4:
